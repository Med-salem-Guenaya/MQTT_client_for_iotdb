this is a java client that uses Mqtt to send data to iotdb with timestamp.

the intrest of this is to have a way to send data from devices that may not be iot devices.

why? well... why not? :)

but really it could be used to monitor the state of devices that might not support other monitoring methods, or keep tabs on certain events occurence for that device...etc
